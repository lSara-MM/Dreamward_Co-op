# Network and Online Games - Exercise 3: Serialization

## Proposed Activity

### 1) Take the scene of your video game and launch it from your lobby. 

### 2) Take a character or object from the client that can be controlled and send information to the server about either: 

* The Position or some other property of the Game Object.
* The Command (key press, click) used by the client to control the Game Object (in this case, the object in the server must move according to the commands on the client).

### 3) On the server, control the clientâ€™s object using the information sent by the client.

### 4) On the server, control a different object than the client and send it to the client.

### 5) On the client, receive the data from the second object and change it as the server commands.

### 6) Use UDP sockets.

### 7) Extras: 

* Full control of position in the scene 
* Send other actions over the network (jump, dash, attack...) 
* Have a game experience
